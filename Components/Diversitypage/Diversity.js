                <p> Aside from extraordinary coffee, Starbucks has made a business out of human connections, community involvement and the celebration of cultures. </p>
                <p> We’re committed to upholding a culture where diversity is valued and respected. So it’s only natural that as a guiding principle, diversity is integral to everything we do.  </p>
                <p> Our company-wide diversity strategy focuses on four areas: partners, customers, suppliers and communities: </p>
                <p> <b> Partners (our employees) - </b> We seek out and engage partners who are as diverse as the communities we serve. </p>
                <p> <b> Customers - </b> We extend the Starbucks Experience to all customers, recognising and responding to their unique preferences and needs. We aim to provide an exceptional customer experience by connecting with our customers in a culturally relevant way. </p>
                <p> <b> Communities – </b> We support and invest in local neighbourhoods and global communities through strategic partnerships and economic development opportunities that deepen our ties in the communities where we do business. </p>
                <p> <b> Suppliers – </b> We are a trusted and welcoming company for suppliers. Through our supplier diversity programme, we work to increase our business relationships with minority- and women-owned suppliers. </p>
                <p> Starbucks is dedicated to creating a workplace that values and respects people from diverse backgrounds, and enables its employees to do their best work. We honour the unique combination of talents, experiences and perspectives of each partner, making Starbucks' success possible. </p>
                <p> As such we expect our partners to act with a spirit of kinship, tolerance and humanity towards all customers, making our stores welcoming to everyone. </p>
